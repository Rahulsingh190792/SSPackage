SSPackage is a software which is used to capture screenshot of active/current window and is pretty useful when we have to capture multiple screenshot for different reason.

### Installation

SSPackage is supported only on windows platform.
SSPackage doesn't require installation, you can download it directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/Rahulsingh190792/SSPackage) and start using it.

### Plugins

SSPackage is currently not extended with plugins but we might come up with few extended plugins in future.
Though we done have any plugins still few changes can be made by the user. The changes needs to be made on properties.configuration file
